      <p id="aboutText">Hi, my name is Paul. Since 2009 I've considered myself a geographer. That was the year I entered
        a M.S. program at Michigan State University.
        I completed my master's in 2011, and in 2012 began a PhD program at Indiana University. <br><br>In 2017, after
        conducting fieldwork in several locations in Kenya
        and successfully defending my disseration, I completed my PhD program. <br><br>Today I am a GIS developer at
        Wayne County, Michigan. I manage GIS software, and,
        primarily, I build GIS applications to improve the public's access to resources and information.<br><br>My
        journey from academia to the public sector has exposed
        me to a range of learning opportunities and GIS challenges. I've equipped my GIS toolbelt with knowledge of
        proprietary and open source GIS software, built geoprocessing
        widgets to be used in client-side analysis, and deployed web GIS environments for the purposes of hosting
        numerous custom built map applications. <br><br> As my
        career path and skills have evolved, I've increasingly involved myself in more coding and development projects.
        And, to my surprise, I've found that I really enjoy this evolution. <br><br> Take a
        look around at some of my GIS products and activities.
